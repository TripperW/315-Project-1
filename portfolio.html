        <h1>Portfolio: </h1>
        <p>My previous projects include the creation of a text based farming game in Python
            and the creation of multiple data structures in C++. In the future, I would like to
            create assistance applications for various tabletop boardgames including Dungeons and
             Dragons as a personal project.
             Unfortunately, at this time I do not possess records of my previous projects
            due to a destroyed hard-drive but in the future all projects will be uplaoded to
             <a href="https://github.com/TripperW">My Git Hub</a>
