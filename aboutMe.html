        <h3>About Me: </h3>
        <p>
            I was born in <a href="https://www.cityofclovis.org/">Clovis, New Mexico</a> in 2001, but moved at a very young age and grew up in
            <a href="https://www.uvaldetx.gov/">Uvalde, Texas</a>. There, I attended the <a href="https://www.swtjc.edu/">Southwest Texas Junior College</a> where I had my first interaction with the world of coding and later software development as a whole, which was my reason for changing my intended major from chemical engineering to computer science.
            I look forward to improving in computer science during my time at A&M namely in the fields of software development and cybersecurity.
            My current focus area is the Japanese Language, the reason for this is both personal interest in the subject as well as the benefits of potentially 
            working in Japan or other foreign countries after graduating with my bachelor's, as 
            I have always wanted to travel the world and spend time living in various countries, whether it be for a couple of weeks or a couple of years.
            With what I learn at A&M I also hope to pick up game design and development as a hobby
            but so far my time has been spent focusing on my degree. 
            My work experience so far has been limited to tutoring in math and writing, customer service work, and construction,
            but I hope to soon take on internships such as in IT and software development-related positions. My skills include experience with
            <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://cplusplus.com/">C++</a>, <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>, Assembly, and HTML, as well as experience with the Office Suite of applications. My history aside, I would describe myself as very task-oriented, becoming single-minded in my work, pursuing its completion until there is nothing left to be done. 
            I would also consider myself a methodical person, planning out my steps to ensure the work gets completed,
            simultaneously I believe I am capable of accepting when a plan goes wrong,
            learning from my mistakes, improving myself, and overall, keeping a level head.
